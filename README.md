# Psychic Game

Psychic Game uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a computer guessing game.

Psychic Game gives you 9 chances to guess a randomly defined character (A-Z). You are alerted if you click a symbol or number, and your previously guessed letters are displayed as you guess. After 9 chances you lose and have the option to start again.
